Flasher Interface\+:

The program running on STM32 intended to act as a interface between the human user and G-\/\+Code processing plotter machine. Final intended use is to create a machine that can autonomously flash a large quantities of ECUs without human supervision.

As part of this project generic libraries will be also developed for\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item joypad abstraction
\item user menu state machine
\item G-\/\+Code generator
\item Logger
\item USART interface
\end{DoxyItemize}

More details will be added as the project progresses.
