Flasher Interface:

The program running on STM32 intended to act as a interface between the
human user and G-Code processing plotter machine. Final intended use is
to create a machine that can autonomously flash a large quantities of ECUs
without human supervision.

As part of this project generic libraries will be also developed for:
- joypad abstraction
- user menu state machine
- G-Code generator
- Logger
- USART interface

More details will be added as the project progresses.
